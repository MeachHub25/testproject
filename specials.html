      <p>While we have some of the best food in the entire city we also have specials that will 
      available to you and your family. All holidays are 50% off everything for every cusmtomer 
      who attends the restaurant that day. Birthday parties are also specials that can be accommodated 
      for you and your family. Renting out the entire restaurant can be arranged, but not on holidays.
